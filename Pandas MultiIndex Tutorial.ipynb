    "Pandas is one of the most-used open source libraries for importing and analyzing data available in Python today. It provides convenient ways to import, view, split, apply, and combine array-like data. And not just convenient, but efficient, too. For example, Pandas' read_csv and to_csv functions are so efficient that the library is often imported just for this task instead of relying on the standard library alternative!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core value of the library, however, comes through several data structure options, primarily Series (for labeled, homogenously-typed, one-dimensional arrays)  and DataFrames (for labeled, potentially heterogeneously-typed, two-dimensional arrays)."

    "DataFrames are two-dimensional, labeled data structures, with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. It is generally the most commonly used Pandas object. Like Series, DataFrame accepts many different kinds of input, including dicts, lists, lists of lists, Series, numpy arrays, other DataFrames, external data from CSVs, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "The index of a DataFrame is a set (i.e. each element is only represented once) that consists of a label for each row. To be helpful, those labels should be not just unique, but also meaningful. By default, if no index is provided, the index will be a numbered range, starting from 0 (known as a range index).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more meaningful index, however, would be something that uniquely describes each row of your data in a way that will help you look things up. For example, in a list of transactions, the date-time might be most useful. Alternatively, in a grade book for a math class the name of the student might be most useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most confusing thing about understanding about Pandas' indexes at first (in my opinion) is how to interact with them. While they look exactly like columns, they're not referenced in the same way (learn more [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html)). Understanding that, I personally find it most useful to think of an index in Pandas like a column that's in time-out and that just can't play with all the other columns.\n",
    " - Note: Another common way in which Pandas' indexes are misunderstood at first is by thinking of them in SQL-like terms. While that can be helpful if that's what you're familiar with, in practice (and for performance) Pandas' and SQL's indexes are quite different (see this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42641018/pandas-column-indexing-for-searching) and [Pandas Under The Hood by Jeff Tratner](http://www.jeffreytratner.com/slides/pandas-under-the-hood-pydata-seattle-2015.pdf))."

    "We've already seen an example of reading a csv, but what if we want to save our multiindex DataFrame and then be able to reread it? How the stored files need to be accessed and by whom they need to be accessed will determine a lot. If everyone who needs access to the data is Python/Pandas savy, [pickling](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.to_pickle.html) is fast and easy. If, however, other, not-tech-savy people will need to access the data, CSVs are a versitile storage medium. That said, it complicates our read_csv() a bit if we want to just dump out our multiindex. Revisiting our multi_col_lvl_df, where we have a multiindex DataFrame that has both multiple index levels and column levels, creates a difficult situation that requires getting to know as many as all 48 (yes, 48!) of read_csv's parameters."

Of particular note is the [Official list of available methods for MultiIndexes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/generated/pandas.MultiIndex.html), which has a full listing of all the available methods (many not listed here). **This link is specifically for Pandas version 0.22, because, for some reason, the list in future versions excludes a lot of still valuable methods!** What's more, this list provides the ONLY explanation for some methods, since many MultiIndex methods lack even the most basic of docstrings."
